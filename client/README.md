# Movie Search UI

This directory contains a simple React.js frontâ€‘end for the movie search service.

It uses Vite with React and Material UI for a modern, responsive interface.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The UI expects the backend API to be available at `/api/v1/search`.
It also fetches the list of cities from `/api/v1/cities` when the search form loads.
